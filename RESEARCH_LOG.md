# Research log (cross-cutting)

Entries to 2026-10-07 are in `archive/sessionLogs/RESEARCH_LOG_root.md` (oldest first), indexed in
`archive/INDEX.md`. Format: one entry per session, at most ~10 lines: what changed, why, where to
look. A lesson that would recur goes to `notes/crossCuttingFindings.md` once, cited by number, not here.

## 2026-10-07 (evening) — the repo cut to the paper as it stands: notes, logs, tests and context

On RKB's instruction, what served the path rather than the paper left the live tree. `notes/` keeps four files (the
TODO, the style guide, the findings, `paper_costLiterature.md`); sixteen closed notes, plans and briefs went to
`archive/notes/`, four 2026-08-23 tex/bib leftovers were deleted. Every session-log entry to this date (67, six logs)
moved to `archive/sessionLogs/`, and `archive/INDEX.md` now opens with the paper's decisions by theme. Retired
diagnostics went to `archive/code/`, superseded results to `archive/results/`; `logs/` keeps `finalRun1002/` and
`finalRunC8/`. The traps moved to the root README, D1's data caveats to `data/README.md`, the `\oa{key}` rule to the
style guide; READMEs, `CLAUDE.md`, the agent definitions and code comments repointed. Tests: `US/test_createCopyFromt0.py`
archived (nothing calls the US model copies), T2's pre-split copy cut, `test_eu.py`'s FRUK check asserts the sheets
load, `paper/test_onlineAppendix.py` registered; the permanent-timing and FOC-layer checks stay (the technical note
quotes them). OA.2 and OA.3 cite appendices E and F; site republished (gh-pages `3d60368`). C9 closed: the two
`informalAnalytical` failures since C8 were a solver stopping rule, fixed in that module (its log); fast suites 24 of 24.

## 2026-10-09 (evening) — the online appendix on a branch in its own worktree

While another session drafts the paper on `main`, the online appendix is rebuilt on branch `oa-revision` in the worktree
`../SSDclaude-oa` (`.venv` a junction to the main checkout's), so neither session's commits interleave with the other's.
The only shared file is the generated `writing/Paper/onlineAppendix.tex`, which defines every key the paper cites.
Plan, decisions and status: `notes/plan_onlineAppendix.md` (untracked in the main checkout); module logs: python/paper,
python/US. Headless Chrome (`--headless=new --virtual-time-budget`) checks the OJS pages when the desktop session is
locked and the browser extension's tab is hidden.

## 2026-10-09 (night) — the online appendix merged, published, and the unused outputs retired

On RKB's go `oa-revision` went into `main` by fast-forward (`ea52b8e`). The idle paper session had uncommitted edits
in four files the branch changes: all its uncommitted work was first stored as a stash ("paper session's uncommitted
work at 58b53fb"), then three-way merged and left uncommitted on the new HEAD. `_escPairs`'s same-reading baseline
and its README line carry over; its edits to code the branch retired (`_escTable`, the old site registry) and the
retired tables' rebuilt files live only in that stash. D5 done: 94 outputs down to 35 (python/paper log). The site
was published from the clean worktree (gh-pages `e3810ba`); worktree and branch removed, run logs kept in `logs/oa`.
The plan is archived (`archive/notes/plan_onlineAppendix.md`); open: TODO W13 (the paper's pointers to the site), C12.
Bash-tool heredocs collapse a double backslash to one: edit scripts with TeX in them go through a file written by Write.
