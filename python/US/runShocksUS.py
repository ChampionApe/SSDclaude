r""" Run the US counterfactuals at one or more rho and write the three paper tables' worth of numbers.

Run:  .venv\Scripts\python.exe python\US\runShocksUS.py                      # rho = 0.5, 1, 2
      ... --rho 1                                the LOG case alone
      ... --family theta                         one family (theta | ageing | french | all)
      ... --commonX                              the common-X calibration variant
      ... --theta VARIANT [--root DIR] [--coarse]  the US at theta imposed (thetaRun)
      ... --theta VARIANT --main                 the pipeline's main variant into results/shocks/

Three families. Each scenario is a NEW EQUILIBRIUM PATH -- the shocked parameters hold over the whole
1960-2200 horizon and the economy starts at its own steady state, not the US's -- read at 2020, and
reported as a full effect (tau re-optimised) and an economic-equilibrium-only effect (tau held at the
baseline path):

    theta    theta = 0 and theta = 1
    ageing   mild (nu -> (1+nu)/2) and acute (nu -> 1), throughout
    french   France's income distribution, leisure preferences, voting, and all three at once

Read by the paper's figure 6.1 (python/paper/figuresUS.usOverview) and the online appendix's counterfactuals
(python/paper/siteData.oecdCounterfactuals), which also carries the economic-equilibrium effect.

The income-distribution scenario holds theta at the US design, so that row is about inequality alone and the
theta family carries pension design.

Plus a FRANCE reference row (--noFrance to skip): France's own calibrated path, read at its own 2020 with
the US workweek reference, so the French-characteristics rows can be read against the country they are
borrowed from. That row is the point of the new-path convention -- an unanticipated 2020 reform is not
commensurable with a country's own equilibrium path, a counterfactual country that has always had these
characteristics is. Note the France row's WORKWEEK is a calibration target (ModelFR targets hours
relative to the US), not a prediction; only its tau and savings rate are results.

See shocks.py for what each shock does and for the reporting conventions (savings rate is s/(w*h), the
workweek is expressed relative to the US baseline, and everything is read at db['t0']). The French
characteristics are read from data/FRMain.xlsx via testEU.py -- France's income groups are cut at US
percentiles precisely so that these swaps are well defined.

The calibration at each rho comes from the US sweep csv (results/calibration/US_rhoGrid{,CommonX}.csv),
so this script never re-runs the outer root: it installs (beta, omega) and solves. That also means every
rho asked for must already be in the sweep.

THE θ VARIANT. --theta VARIANT imposes theta on the US as db['θ0'] = the US row of data/oecd26_theta.csv under
VARIANT (ModelUS.getθ, oecd26.thetaFromFile): the baseline and every US-based scenario carry it, the income row
holds theta at it, and the theta family still sets 0 and 1. The calibration is the variant's own sweep,
DIR/calibration/US_rhoGrid{,CommonX}.csv (calibrateRhoGrid.py --theta, at that θ0: oecd26.usBeta), which is also
France's US reference (beta imposed, hours); France takes its θ0 from the same file (the FRA row,
oecd26.countryθ0) in the reference row and in the calibration its characteristics are read from (frenchData), with
omega recalibrated at it. DIR is the variant's directory (oecd26.thetaDir, results/oecd26_theta_<variant>/;
results/ under --main, the pipeline's main variant, oecd26.thetaRoot), the csv DIR/shocks/US_shocks{,CommonX}.csv
with thetaSource, θ0 and grid columns; --coarse (variant only) puts the tax grid at 51 nodes.

Writes results/shocks/US_shocks{,CommonX}.csv -- one row per (rho, family, scenario, effect), each with the
tax counts of its solve (nEqMax, nCandMax, nFallback; policy.multiplicityColumns): the baseline's, France's and
each scenario's full effect (shocks.runOne's 'multiplicity'); -1 on the 'ee' rows, which select no tax. A run
replaces the rows of its own (rho, family, scenario, effect) in the csv and keeps the others (`writeRows`), so a
subset (--rho 1, --family theta) leaves the rest; rows at another θ than the run's (thetaSource, θ0) are dropped, a
csv holds one θ. The file is written through a temporary file and renamed. France's reference row is the one failure
a run survives: it is printed, the run goes on, and main exits 1 (runESC.noteFailure). A relative --out or --root is
the caller's working directory's.
