r""" ModelFR -- the US model calibrated against a US reference rather than on its own.

France and the UK are the same model as `ModelUS` (see model.py and writing/US/); only the calibration
protocol differs, in the two ways the paper states (Quant.tex, "Social Security in Rich OECD Countries"):

  1. beta is IMPOSED at the value the US calibration produced at the same rho, not searched. The interest
     rate stops being a target with it, so eq:calibration collapses from a 2-D root over (beta, omega) to
     a 1-D root over omega against tau_{t0}. R is still reported -- it is now a prediction.

  2. Average hours are targeted in BOTH calibration variants, not only under commonX, and the target is
     defined relative to the US:

         hbar_FR = hbar_US * workweek_FR / workweek_US

     with hbar_US the calibrated US model's average hours at the same rho and the workweeks from data.
     Under vector X this is the only form of hours target that identifies anything: nothing else in that
     calibration pins the level of hbar (docs eq:us:model:hoursUnit; see the README's note that hbar must
     be reported against a reference point). Under commonX it is not a new target at all:
     hbar_US = h0_US exactly there, so it reduces to the observed workweek_FR the US variant already uses.

Under vector X the target is hit by moving every X_i by the same proportion -- the scale invariance
(eq:us:model:scaleInvariance), applied through ModelUS.rescaleX. Consequences worth stating plainly:

  * Gamma_h = 1 NO LONGER HOLDS on a calibrated ModelFR. initProductivity_vectorX still imposes it, but
    the post-root rescaling leaves Gamma_h = lambda. Note what this is and is not: Gamma_h = 1 is a
    NORMALISATION in ModelUS, where nothing pins the level of hours; here the hours target pins it, so
    Gamma_h comes out DATA-DETERMINED rather than free. It still sets the level of h, s, c and Y (it is
    unidentified only jointly with TFP, which base.py normalises to A = 1), so it is not a quantity to
    treat as irrelevant -- only one that no longer equals 1. A check asserting Gamma_h = 1 is wrong here.
  * lambda is block-recursive to the omega root, exactly as commonX's X is: the scale invariance leaves
    tau, R, w, theta, s_i/s and the savings rate pointwise unchanged, so the rescaling cannot disturb the
    target omega was just solved for. That is asserted, not assumed, by the `verify` drift check.

France additionally has theta = 1, but that needs no code: ModelUS.getTheta (getθ) returns exactly 1 when
the workbook's RR0 = 1, for ANY income grouping -- which is precisely why France's groups may be cut at US
percentiles. So this class serves the UK unchanged too; only the workbook differs.

Needs, beyond a ModelUS's inputs: db['h0'] (the observed workweek in the model's time unit, as in
test.py) and a US reference -- see setUSRef and usRefFromCsv.
