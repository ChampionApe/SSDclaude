""" Bounded-root reparameterization (writing/*_docs.tex, "Robust root finding with bounds", eq:root).

Generic, model-agnostic: wraps any first-order-condition function f (only meaningful/safe to evaluate on
[l,u], e.g. a tax rate confined to [0,1]) into an unconstrained residual h(z,τ) that a gradient-based
root-finder (e.g. scipy.optimize.root/newton) can search over all of ℝ without ever calling f outside its
safe domain. Interior candidates (τ∈[l,u]) evaluate f directly and h=f. Candidates outside [l,u] are
extended with an artificial linear penalty anchored at f(l)/f(u): the sign of the penalty term is set up
so h still points back toward the relevant bound even when f itself has no interior root or isn't
monotonic there (see the doc's two boundary-detection examples). Recover the actual bounded policy from a
solved τ̃ via clip(τ̃, l, u). """

    boundary solution, but too steep can hurt the root-finder's own step-size heuristics). """
