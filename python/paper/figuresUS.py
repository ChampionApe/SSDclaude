r""" Figure builders for the US/France/UK arm. figures.py is the Argentina arm and owns the house style;
this module imports it rather than restating it, so the two arms stay one visual family.

Style rules that apply here specifically:
  * The counterfactuals are a CATEGORICAL set, not a continuous parameter, so they get the categorical
    pair -- never THETA_RAMP, which is reserved for a parameter that varies continuously.
  * The baseline is a reference line, not a series: it is drawn in ink, not in a series colour, so it
    cannot be mistaken for one of the scenarios being compared against it.
  * Every panel plots the DEVIATION from the baseline, never the level. The levels differ by a few
    points on a 14% base and a 39-hour base, which a level axis compresses into indistinguishable bars;
    the deviation is also the only thing the workweek column means, since under vector X the level of
    hbar is not identified and only its ratio to the baseline is a result. The one exception is the
    pension design in the ESC figure, where the corners 0 and 1 are meaningful and the level is read.
  * Savings are reported over GDP, s/Y, in both figures -- the shock csv's `srOverY`, and in the ESC
    figure (1 - alpha) times the csv's s/(wh), since wh = (1 - alpha) Y. alpha is read from the
    calibration summary, never typed.
  * NOT config.pct anywhere in here. It escapes the percent sign for tex and matplotlib renders the
    backslash literally, so a legend built with it reads "14.4\%". Anything drawn INTO a figure needs
    plain formatting; config.pct is for tex cells only.

# The rows of the overview, in the order the paper's discussion moves in: pension design, then ageing (the
# two it identifies as the main determinants), then France's characteristics in UKUS_French's order.
# Reading the finished figure top-to-bottom should reproduce that ranking, so the order is fixed here
# rather than sorted by effect size: a figure whose ordering changes with the data cannot be referred to
# in prose. Each row is (row label, [(csv scenario, mark label), ...], shock family, how a second scenario
# is drawn). A row with two scenarios is one bar per rho (_barPanel): 'tone' draws both from the baseline,
# the FIRST in the series colour and the second in its light tone (theta = 0 and theta = 1, on either side
# of the US design); 'line' draws the first as the bar and marks the second by a line across it (mild
# ageing inside acute ageing). The figure carries no key for either: the paper's note explains them. The
# composite rows (all three French characteristics, France's own path) are the tables' business.

def escOverview():
    r""" Figure \ref{fig:US_ESC:overview}: what each counterfactual does when the pension design is
    chosen politically, against what it does at a fixed design -- as dumbbells from the pinned reading
    (open marker) to the chosen one (filled marker), one per (scenario, rho).

    Four panels in a 2 x 2 grid. The design itself first, as a LEVEL: every dumbbell there starts at
    the US design, so its length is the design response and the muted lines at 0 and 1 are the corners
    the text refers to. Then the tax rate, savings over GDP and the average workweek as deviations from
    the endogenous-theta baseline, so the pinned end is the main-text reading and the dumbbell is what
    endogenising the design adds. A row whose markers all round to the reference says 'unchanged' (France's
    taste for leisure in the design and tax panels). In the savings and workweek panels that row's pinned
    markers sit off zero by the baseline's own gap between the readings: savings and hours in 2020 respond
    to the design chosen for 2050, which the chosen baseline raises above theta*.

    2 x 2 rather than one row of four: at \linewidth a row of four narrow panels shrinks the type below
    legibility and squeezes the tax panel's 12-point range into an inch. The grid keeps every panel at
    half the width, and the scenario labels are repeated on the left of each row so a panel can be read
    without tracing back across the page. All four share one scenario axis (sharey), so inverting it
    once (_topDown) puts the first scenario at the top everywhere.

    The workweek is in hours, normalised against that rho's own baseline inside the ESC driver (the
    csv's ww_t0), for the reason tablesUS.py gives: under vector X the level of hbar is not identified,
    so stage (iii) never re-derives it.

    Every row is a new equilibrium path whose political choice binds from the first period, so the
    design in force in 2020 is itself an outcome. All panels are read at 2020.
