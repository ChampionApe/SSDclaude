Four stages, each writing its own csv under results/esc/:

  calib    for every (spec, phi): p such that the equilibrium design IN FORCE at 2020 is the observed one
           (ModelESC.leadedDesignAtT0), with (beta, omega) recalibrated inside. Plus the no-wedge row,
           which is the corner the whole exercise is trying to escape. Every row also carries Vtilde,
           fStar = f(theta*, tau0), f0 = f(0, tau0) and tau0 (wedgeReadout), which the paper's calibration
           table prints; under 'size' the 'p' column IS lambda and 'phi' is the dummy 0.5.
  path     the equilibrium path of theta_t under the calibrated wedge, with the choice binding from the
           first period -- the ageing prediction, and the closest thing the model has to figure 1.1's
           cross-section.
  shocks   the counterfactuals of shocks.py (ageing, French income distribution / leisure / voting, and
           all three at once), plus a France reference row, each run twice: theta PINNED at the shocked
           model's exogenous design, and theta chosen. Every one is a NEW EQUILIBRIUM PATH -- the shocked
           parameters hold over the whole horizon, the economy starts at its own steady state, the
           political choice binds from the first period -- and is REPORTED AT t0 (2020). t0+1 is written
           too, but the tables read t0: because theta_{t0} is now an equilibrium outcome rather than a
           pinned datum, 2020 already carries the design response.
  country  France and the UK under (i) the US-calibrated wedge and (ii) their own. (i) asks whether one
           common technology of redistribution puts the three countries in the observed order; (ii) is the
           appendix's own convention (a separately calibrated p per country).
  pathHost the path stage on France and the UK, under the US-calibrated p and under their own
           (escCountry.csv) -> escPathHost.csv.
  corner   'size' only: the slope of the leaded design objective at the Bismarckian corner, theta_{t+1} = 1,
           and the tax there, for France, the U.S. and the UK at lambda = 0, the U.S. lambda and 100, the
           1990 and the 2020 electorate (app:esc:cost: under log both are free of lambda, so a negative slope
           means no lambda re-elects the corner) -> escCornerSlope.csv. Each row is recalibrated at its
           lambda, so the slope is lambda-free only where the observed design is the corner (France at its
           workbook θ = 1): an economy observed below it (the U.S. and the UK; France too under a θ variant, at
           countryθ0) has omega, and with it the slope, move with the cost.

--theta VARIANT [--root DIR | --main] [--coarse] (stages calib, path, pathHost, shocks, country, corner; `setTheta`):
every U.S. model imposes theta as db['θ0'] = the U.S. row of data/oecd26_theta.csv under VARIANT (ModelUS.getθ,
oecd26.thetaFromFile), so the calib stage puts that design in force in 2020, (beta, omega) recalibrated inside as
always; France and the UK impose theirs, the FRA and GBR rows (oecd26.countryθ0, `buildEU`, `frenchData`), with omega
recalibrated at it (France at the U.S. income cuts). The variant's directory DIR (default
results/oecd26_theta_<variant>/, oecd26.thetaDir; results/ under --main, the pipeline's main variant,
oecd26.thetaRoot) holds its U.S. sweep, DIR/calibration/ (calibrateRhoGrid.py --theta: required, at that θ0), which
seeds the U.S. and is France's and the UK's U.S. reference (beta imposed, hours). The csvs go to DIR/esc/ (results/esc/
only under --main), their rows adding thetaSource, θ0 (the U.S.'s) and grid, and a stage that reads
escCalibration.csv or escCountry.csv refuses the rows it reads at another thetaSource, θ0 or grid (checkCalib).
--coarse (variant only): GRIDS['coarse'].

Spec 'sizePiR' (ModelESC: the 'size' cost with lambda*Pi_t/R_t, pi solved to the path's own) runs the calib,
path, shocks and country stages; its rows carry 'ΠR', pi at the row's date (t0 for calib, shocks and country).
Run it with a --tag: it is an experiment beside the paper's cost, not a row of the paper's csvs.

Everything is LOG (rho = 1). The CRRA case needs a two-dimensional (s, theta) state and is not this file.

A failure a stage survives (a scenario, France's row, a country's cost) is printed, the run goes on, and main exits 1
with the list at the end (`noteFailure`); a calibration that does not converge is a row with converged False, not a
failure. A relative --root is the caller's working directory's (the script itself runs in python/US).
