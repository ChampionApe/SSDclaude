r""" Endogenous system characteristics: the LEADED choice of theta (app:ESC, "Leaded choices of theta_t"),
under LOG (LeadedLOG) and CRRA (LeadedCRRA) preferences.

theta_{t+1} is chosen at t by the same probabilistic-voting objective that chooses tau_t, and is a STATE
at t+1. What makes the LOG case cheap is a property of the US model (no informal household), verified in
test_esc.py rather than assumed:

    z_t -- the FOC for tau_t -- depends on (tau_t, theta_t) ALONE.

theta_{t+1} enters z_t only through Theta_{h,t} -- as do tau_{t+1} and, under the 'size' wedge, f(theta_{t+1},
tau_{t+1}) -- which reaches the FOC only through dv20 (the old informal household), and that term carries
weight gamma_0 = 0 here. So tau_t = tauPolicy_t(theta_t) is a STATIC scalar problem, the two choices at t
are separable, and the state is one-dimensional.

Two further properties, both MEASURED (test_esc.py) rather than assumed, and both specific to LOG:

  * the choice does not depend on s_{t-1} -- ln(s_{t-1}) enters every term of W_t additively, which is the
    appendix's own normalisation ("simply assume that s_{t-1} = 1");
  * the choice does not depend on theta_t EITHER. ln(h_t), ln(ctilde_{1,t}^i) and ln(R_{t+1}) are each
    additively separable in tau_t and theta_{t+1}, so W_t = A(tau_t) + B(theta_{t+1}); theta_t reaches W_t
    only through tau_t, so it cannot move the argmax. thetaPolicy_t comes back constant across the state
    grid to machine precision.

Under CRRA both fail: the powers do not separate. LeadedCRRA therefore solves the PATH rather than a
policy function -- see its own docstring for what that costs and how the residual state-dependence is
measured rather than hoped away.

THE OBJECTIVE, in both cases:

    W_t = sum_i gamma_{t-1,i} omega p_{t-1} mu_{t-1,i} v_{2,t}^i + nu_t sum_i gamma_{t,i} mu_{t,i} v_{1,t}^i

with (model_PEE.tex) v_1^i = (1+beta_i)ln(ctilde_1^i) + beta_i ln(R_{t+1}) and v_2^i = ln(c_2^i) under LOG,
and v_1^i = (1+B_{t+1}^i)(ctilde_1^i)^{1-1/rho}/(1-1/rho), v_2^i = (c_2^i)^{1-1/rho}/(1-1/rho) under CRRA.
The weights are Base.FOC's own, so the objective and the tau-FOC cannot be weighted differently.

WHY A GRID AND NOT A FOC. The whole point of the exercise is to find out whether the choice is interior,
so the solver must be able to return a corner as a corner. Both solvers evaluate W_t on a grid of
candidates, take the argmax, and refine it parabolically when interior; a corner is reported as such.
Differentiating W_t would buy speed and cost exactly the property being measured.

class LeadedCRRA(LeadedBase):
    r""" The leaded choice under CRRA, solved as a PATH rather than as a policy function.

    Under CRRA neither LOG simplification survives: v = c^{1-1/rho}/(1-1/rho) does not turn products into
    sums, so W_t is not additively separable in (tau_t, theta_{t+1}) and s_{t-1} does not drop out. The
    honest Markov object is a policy function over the two-dimensional state (s_{t-1}, theta_t), i.e. a
    2-D version of policy.py's CRRA grid. This class does something cheaper and says exactly what it
    assumes:

        Iterate on the equilibrium PATH {theta_t}. At each t, evaluate W_t over a grid of candidate
        theta_{t+1}, re-solving the WHOLE CRRA equilibrium (model.solvePEE_CRRA, unchanged) for each
        candidate while holding theta_{t+2}, ... at the current iterate. Take the argmax, sweep forward,
        repeat until the path stops moving.

    WHAT THAT ASSUMES. Holding theta_{t+2} fixed while theta_{t+1} varies is exactly right if the choice
    at t+1 does not respond to the design it inherits. Under LOG that is not an approximation at all --
    thetaPolicy is provably constant in theta_t (module docstring). Under CRRA it is an approximation, and
    stateSensitivity() measures it directly: it re-runs the t+1 choice at two different theta_{t+1} and
    reports how far the response moves. Report that number alongside any result from this class; if it is
    not small, the 2-D grid is required and this shortcut is not good enough.

    Re-solving for each candidate is also what makes the envelope logic right: tau_t is re-optimised at
    every candidate, so its own response to theta_{t+1} contributes nothing to first order, and W_t is
    evaluated at the equilibrium tau rather than at a stale one. """

    (s_{t-1}, θ_t), identified by backward iteration -- the "honest Markov object" LeadedCRRA's docstring
    names and does not compute. No path iteration and no held-fixed future: the choice of θ_{t+1} at t
    sees continuation policies τ_{t+1}(s_t, θ_{t+1}) and h_{t+1}(s_t, θ_{t+1}) that already embed the
    choice at t+1 responding to the design it inherits.

    STRUCTURE, per period t (mirrors policy.CRRA's alg:CRRA:grid with one extra layer):

      1. For every (τ_t, s_{t-1}, θ_{t+1}-candidate): resolve the equilibrium state s_t (the same fixed
         point as the exogenous solver -- _rootS -- with the continuation read off 2-D interpolants).
      2. z_t on that grid. Everything except the old formal households' dv2i is independent of the
         inherited design θ_t (θ_t enters only through the benefit split of the CURRENT old), so the
         grid carries no θ_t axis: dv2i alone is recomputed per θ_t node, with the numerical
         τ-derivatives (the expensive splines) shared across all of them.
      3-4. The choice (τ_t, θ_{t+1}) at every state (s_{t-1}, θ_t), by designRule:
         'root' (the default; alg esc:crra2D, the equilibrium at a state eq:esc:stateEq). The retirees'
           shares are the one-parameter family of eq:esc:aDef (aOf, sharesFrom). At a frozen a: the tax
           best response on the grid (frozenTaxPass), the design θ̂'(a) by LeadedBase._argmax over θ1 of
           V(θ'; a) = W_t(τ̂(θ'; a), θ'; a), τ̂(a) and h_t by np.interp along θ1, and the residual
           r(a) = a - a_t(τ̂(a), h_t) of eq:esc:aResidual (_bestAt). r is tabulated on Ma nodes spanning
           the consistent a_t of every grid node of the state plus one cell at each end; every sign change
           is closed to aTolBracket (aClose: 'secant', _closeSecant; 'bisection', _closeBisection) and is
           an equilibrium if |r| <= aTolResidual there, a jump otherwise. Among several equilibria the
           highest V(θ̂'; a); none: fallbackθ and the 'legacy' answer at that state.
         'legacy': τ*(s_, θ_t, θ1) by the selection rule along τ (num_robustroot.tex) at every candidate
           design, W_t there (young: Σ young·hatc1iPow/q; old: Σ old·c_2^{1-1/ρ}/q) with the retirees'
           shares consistent with each candidate's own τ* and h_t, argmax over θ1 with parabolic
           refinement, corners preserved, τ at the refined θ1 by linear interpolation. It values a
           candidate design at shares the electorate does not control; kept for comparisons, and runs the
           pinned periods (choose = False) under either rule.
      5. Tabulate τ/θNext/s/h/Γs at the chosen policies, smooth τ along s with PINNED knots
         (crossCuttingFindings #5), rebuild the tables' interpolants for period t-1.

    Steps 1-2 are _periodCore, 3-4 _choose (_chooseRoot or _chooseLegacy), 5 _handBack.

    Period-dict entries of the root layer, (nθ, ns_) unless noted: nBrθ (brackets), nEqθ (closed
    brackets), fallbackθ, nIterθ (closing iterations), aStar, Vstar, rStar, τChosen (τ̂(a*) before the
    smoothing of step 5); Vθ (nθ, ns_, nθ1) = V(θ'; a*); nPass (frozen passes in the period). Its
    tax-rule entries (τStar3, nEqτ, nCandτ, fallbackτ, W) are NaN / -1 unless a fallback ran the legacy
    layer in that period.

    The recursion is DIRECT -- terminal condition plus one backward pass -- so unlike LeadedCRRA's path
    iteration it needs no warm start and no convergence tolerance; the path iteration is kept as the
    cheap cross-check (validated against this class, not the other way around).

    PINNING (the timing the wedge calibration targets) is built into the recursion rather than only the
    simulation: for positions pos < pinPos the choice of θ_{pos+1} is FORCED to θPin (the candidate grid
    collapses to that one point), because under CRRA τ_t genuinely depends on θ_{t+1} -- pinning only at
    simulation time would evaluate τ off the pinned continuation. Under LOG the distinction vanishes,
    which is why LeadedLOG can pin in simulate() alone.

    Grid settings are borrowed from the model's exogenous solver (self.GS = m.CRRA.GS at solve time), so
    a driver that tunes m.CRRA.initGS(...) tunes this class with it. """

class PermanentLOG(LeadedLOG):
    r""" The PERMANENT choice of theta (app:ESC, "Permanent choice of theta"), LOG case.

    At the reform date t0 the electorate chooses a theta expected to hold forever: theta_t = theta for
    every t >= t0. It therefore enters THREE channels at once, where the leaded choice enters one:

        the sequential channel   theta_{t0} re-splits the CURRENT retirees' benefits (the appendix's
                                 E_{2,t}^{i,theta}), which is what corners the sequential choice at zero;
        the leaded channel       theta_{t0+1} moves h_{t0}, hence every period-t0 quantity;
        the continuation         theta_{t0+k} moves tau_{t0+k} and the whole future path.

    TWO THINGS MAKE THIS CHEAPER THAN THE APPENDIX'S RECIPE, and both are worth stating because they are
    not obvious from the write-up, which proposes a two-dimensional grid over (tau_{t0}, theta).

    1. THE JOINT CHOICE CONCENTRATES. dW/dtau = 0 is the ordinary tau first-order condition evaluated at
       theta_t = theta -- the permanent choice adds nothing to it, since theta is not a function of tau.
       So the optimal tau at any candidate theta is just tauPolicy_{t0}(theta), already available, and what
       is left is a ONE-dimensional maximisation over theta. The 2-D grid is not wrong, only redundant.

    2. tau_t FOR t > t0 IS THE ORDINARY PEE AT CONSTANT theta. Nothing about the continuation is special:
       once theta is fixed forever, later periods face exactly the exogenous-theta problem tauPolicy
       already solves. There is no recursion to run.

    THE ONE THING THAT MUST NOT BE GOT WRONG. s_{t0-1,i}/s_{t0-1} is a PREDETERMINED state, and here theta
    enters it (through theta_{t0}) in a way it never does in the leaded problem. Savings at t0-1 are SUNK
    when the vote is taken at t0: a voter comparing two candidates does not get a different s_{t0-1,i}
    under each. So the ratio is one number, passed in as an argument, and never recomputed per candidate --
    the same error base.dlnc2i_dτ's docstring forbids for tau. Letting it move is worth 0.13 in theta, and
    is also internally inconsistent with the tau it is paired with: si_s depends on tau_t0 as well as
    theta_t0, while tau_t0 comes from z_t = 0, which is BUILT holding the ratio fixed. It would break the
    concentration argument above.

    WHICH number it is pinned at is a separate question, and it is the timing that answers it. The vote is
    ANTICIPATED: households arrive at t0 knowing a design will be chosen, so the savings they made at t0-1
    were made against the design that actually wins. Rational expectations therefore make the choice a
    FIXED POINT -- solveFixedPoint below -- and not the incumbent's ratio, which is the unanticipated
    reading. The two coincide exactly wherever the chosen design equals the incumbent one, which is what
    the wedge calibration targets, so the calibrated p is the same under both; they separate only away
    from it. ModelESC.solvePermanent exposes all three readings and reports the gaps. """
