r""" The cross-country test of section 7's model (python/US/runOECD26.py, results/oecd26/): the panel data shared
with figuresOECD26, the slopes of figure 1.1's relations in the data and in the model (all five, OECD26_Slopes; the
two of section 6's spending test at the observed designs without the cost, spendingSlopes), the calibrated political
weights (OECD26_Omega), the five slopes under appendix G's population and data variants (OECD26_Variants), and the
predicted against the observed design (thetaFit, figuresOECD26's OECD26_ThetaFit*).

THE DESIGN'S MEASURE (`theta`, config.US['theta'] by default): the data side's index is I = 1/(2 - θ) of that variant
of data/oecd26_theta.csv and its spending the variant's, on its countries (datasets.oecd26SampleOf: inSample and a
finite θ); the model's rows are the variant's (datasets.oecd26Dir). `theta` 'paper' is figure 1.1's index on
data/oecd26_sample.csv's sample26, with the 'index' rows of results/oecd26/.

Every builder takes
  turnout  'csesFlat' (each economy at its own CSES propensities to vote; Luxembourg, which has none and enforces
           compulsory voting, flat) | 'cses' (Luxembourg left out of data and model alike) | 'cps' (every economy at
           the U.S. CPS propensities; rows of before 2026-11-04);
  sample   '26', the sample of the design's measure (above);
  reading  'inForce' (the design in force in 2020 on the freely simulated path, chosen in 1990: the reading of the
           cost parameter's target) | 'chosen' (the design chosen in 2020 at the observed design, in force from 2050);
  spec     the cost transported from the U.S. anchor: 'sizePiR' (λ_n = ε Π_n/R_n for country n, the anchor's ε in
           the csvs' `p`), 'size' (the anchor's λ) | 'none' (no cost; the model then reads no design);
  betaRule 'common' (the anchor's β in every country) | 'commonR' (each country's β set so that its 2020 return is
           the anchor's);
  spending the model's spending: 'chosen' (100 τInForce (1 - α), the 2020 tax on the path whose design in force is the
           chosen one, = spending2020 τInForce/τ2020; reading 'inForce' and a cost only) | 'observed' (spending2020, the
           tax at the observed design, which layer 2's ω matches by construction);
  omegaRule layer 1's ω: 'mean' (the mean of layer 2's) | 'anchor' (the U.S. anchor's);
  retAge   ν's retirement-age correction: 'nra' (statutory age) | 'none' | 'exit' (effective exit age);
  theta    the design's measure (config.THETANAMES): config.US['theta'] or a data variant (results/oecd26_theta_<V>/);
each None for the paper's variant, PAPER, which is config.US['oecd26']'s (sample '26', spending its
`spendingReading`, theta config.US['theta']; under spec 'none' spending is 'observed'). An output's name and label
carry the parts that differ from the paper's variant (`suffix`: '_cses', '_omegaUS', '_nuNone', '_thetaB', ...). The
model's design enters every regression on the index's scale, I = 1/(2 - θ),
the inverse of the loader's θ = 2 - 1/I; spending is 100 τ (1 - α), % of GDP, the inverse of the calibration's τ0. Both
sides of every slope use figure 1.1's regressors (OECD population growth 2020/1990, the WIID Gini) and the same
countries.
